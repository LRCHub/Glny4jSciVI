There comes a time
When we heed a certain call
When the world
must come together as one.
There are people dying
Ooohhh and it's time
to lend a hand
To life, the greatest
gift of all.
We can't go on
Pretending day by day
That someone somewhere will
soon make a change.
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth
You know Love is all we need.
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones
who make a brighter day
So let's start giving.
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives.
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me.
Well Send them your heart
So they know that someone cares
And that life
will be stronger and free
As God has shown us
by turning stone to bread
And so that we all
must lend a helping hand
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones
who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me.
When you're down and out
And there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we could fall
Well now now now let us realize
Ohhh that a change can only come
When we stand together as one
yeah yeah yeah yeahh
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones
who make a brighter day
So let's start giving.
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives.
It's true we make a better day
