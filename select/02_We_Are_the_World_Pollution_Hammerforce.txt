Away from me, I tell you
Take off these wraps of lies
In ruins of your ambition
Our raped homeplanet lies

We are the nature's rubbish
We are the parasites
There are too many of us
But you're still telling lies

Hungry parasites
We are destroying our home

Chorus:
It's time we heard
Cry of our raped motherland
It's time we saw
Wounds of our hurt motherland

World pollution

We are the stupid creatures
We are the silly fools
In this world we call ours
Another power rules

Hungry parasites
We are destroying our home

Repeat chorus
