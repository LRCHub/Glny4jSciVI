There comes a time
When we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying, ooh
And it's time to lend a hand
To life the greatest gift of all

We can't go on
Pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know, love is all we need

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

Well, send them your hearts
So they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us
By turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world,
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

When you're down and out
And there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, well let us realize
Ooh, the change can only come
When we stand together as one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
Yeah, we're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

We are the world (We are the world)
We are the children (We are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving (So let's start giving)
